Diffusion is a process in which a substance spreads out over time, and in the context of diffusion models, it is used to generate new data samples. The model is trained on a large dataset of existing data samples and learns to approximate the distribution of the original data. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to generate new data samples that are similar to the original data.
