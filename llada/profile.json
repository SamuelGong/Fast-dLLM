The model works by first transforming the original data into a \"diffused\" version by adding random noise, and then using a series of linear algebra operations to transform the it back to to the original data. This \"reversible diffusion process\" is used to learn a model of the data distribution, which can be used to generate new data samples that are similar to the original data. Diffusion models have been used in a variety of applications, including image generation, text generation, and audio synthesis."
