The idea is to take a set of data points and gradually add noise to them, and then remove the noise to recover the original data points. This process is repeated many times, and the model learns to generate new data points that are similar to the original data. The model is trained using a technique called contrastive, where it is asked to generate a sample that is similar to a sample from the training data. By repeating this process, the model can learn to distinguish between samples that resemble the training data and those that don't.",

They are commonly used in natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The basic idea behind diffusion models is to generate a sequence of noisy versions of the input data, and then reverse the process to generate a new data sample. The process is typically done in a sequential manner, with each step adding more noise to the data. The goal is to learn a model that can reverse the process and generate a new data sample. Diffusion models have been shown to be very effective in generating high-quality data samples from a probability distribution.",

It combines a language model with a retrieval system to enhance the generation process. The retrieval system is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a large corpus of text, which is then used to inform the language model's generation process. This allows the language model to generate more accurate and relevant text, as it has access to a wider range of information. RAG has been shown to improve the performance of language models in tasks such as text generation and summar answering.",
